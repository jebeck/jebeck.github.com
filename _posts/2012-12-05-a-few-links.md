*I thought it would be a good idea to gather up all the links to the various places around the Internet where I've talked about my diabetes in the last six months. So...*

### Quantified Self

I'm mentioned in [the recap](http://quantifiedself.com/2012/05/new-york-qs-showtell-16-recap/ "NY QS #16 Recap") of the sixteenth New York Quantified Self Show&Tell meetup.

And the video of my Show&Tell presentation ("Lessons Learned from 100,000+ Blood Glucose Readings") at that meetup is [here](http://quantifiedself.com/2012/07/jana-beck-on-learning-from-over-100000-blood-glucose-readings/ "Video of my presentation at NY QS #16").[^a]

### The [Diabetes Mine](http://www.diabetesmine.com/ "Diabetes Mine") Patient Voices Contest

I entered [a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUF71NV_Rio&feature=g-upl "My Diabetes Mine Patient Voices contest video") in [the Diabetes Mine Patient Voices contest](http://www.diabetesmine.com/designcontest "The 2012 Diabetes Mine Patient Voices Contest") <span class="aside">[JEB, 2016: This resource behind this link appears to have disappeared... ðŸ˜ž]</span>. After being selected as a winner, I was [interviewed at Diabetes Mine](http://www.diabetesmine.com/2012/08/meet-jana-beck-grad-student-with-big-ideas-about-diabetes-tech.html "Diabetes Mine interview").

Finally, after attending the 2012 Diabetes Mine Innovation Summit as a Patient Voices contest winner, my reaction to the Summit is quoted in [the Diabetes Mine wrap-up post](http://www.diabetesmine.com/2012/11/straight-talking-at-the-2012-diabetesmine-innovation-summit.html "Diabetes Mine: Straight Talking at the 2012 Diabetes Mine Innovation Summit").
