## prequisites

A basic understanding of [domain registration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_registration 'Wikipedia: Domain registration') in terms of both the nuts & bolts of how you do it in the U.S.[^a] and the motivating benefits of registering your own domain(s).

## ðŸ“œ the tale

### intro

Herein lies the more-fascinating-than-it-has-any-right-to-be tale of me attempting to register an Estonian domain name. I arrived in Estonia for the [Refresh 2017 conference](http://refresh.rocks/ 'Refresh 2017') yesterday, and in the taxi from the airport to the hotel, I noticed that all the web addresses on signs ended in `.ee`, so I looked it up to double-check, and yes, `.ee` is the Estonian top-level domain (TLD). (The Estonian word for "Estonia" is *Eesti*, so it's transparent how this came about.)

My mind was immediately drawn to the [domain hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack 'Wikipedia: domain hack') possibilites that `.ee` would afford. Perhaps I could host my portfolio at `http://galler.ee`, for example[^b].

At first, it was just an idle thought, but later in the evening I decided it'd be fun to just give it a try and see if I could register `galler.ee` or `honeyb.ee` or something equally cool.

### step 1: check Hover

I've registered the other domains I own with [Hover](http://hover.com/ 'Hover'), so I checked there first to see if I could register the `.ee` domain(s) of my dreams: no <span alt="dice">ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²</span>.

### step 2: find out where can you register `.ee` domains

So my next task was to figure out where it is possible to register `.ee` domains. So I...Googled. Spent a bit of time on [eNic.ee](http://www.enic.ee/ 'eNic'), but it doesn't include the ability to quickly check if a domain is already registered, so I moved on to (Zone.ee)(https://www.zone.ee/en/ 'Zone.ee') and spent a glorious hour or so making a long list of available `.ee` domains it would be "fun" to have.

### step 3: actually register an `.ee` domain

[^a]: Spoiler: not nearly as securely as how you do it in Estonia!

[^b]: This one is already registered, sadly.
