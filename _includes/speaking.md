## speaking

One of the things I'm enjoying most in my career switch from academia into tech is the vibrant *collaborative* culture in tech, expressed in the highest concentration at meetups and conferences. I love sharing what I've learned on the job and learning complementary lessons from others' experiences, and I'm deeply impressed, humbled, and inspired by all the speakers who put extensive amounts of time into communicating subtle or difficult or often-overlooked concepts for the benefit of all. üëè

I've also had the honor of taking the stage myself to present on a few topics:

- In **October 2016**, I presented [High-stakes React](http://janabeck.com/high-stakes-react/#/?_k=1u1qb0 'High-stakes React slides') at [ReactNL](http://reactnl.org/ 'React NL').
- In **August 2015**, I presented [Flux for Data Visualization: A Preliminary Manifesto](http://janabeck.com/flux-for-dataviz/ 'Flux for Data Visualization slides') at [React Rally](http://www.reactrally.com/ 'React Rally'). The [video of this talk](https://youtu.be/Fb8QB4FoKrI 'Video of Flux for Data Visualization talk') is available on YouTube.
- In **July 2015**, I presented [Power Tools for Powerful Visualization](http://janabeck.com/dataviz-power-tools/ 'Power Tools for Powerful Visualization slides') at [CascadiaFest 2015](http://2015.cascadiajs.com/ 'CascadiaFest 2015'), a 3-day conference dedicated to CSS, front-end JavaScript, and server-side JavaScript. The [video and a transcript of this talk](http://2015.cascadiajs.com/speakers/jana-beck 'Jana Beck's CascadiaFest 2015 talk') are available on the CascadiaFest website.
- In **December 2014**, I presented ["tideline (and zipline)"](http://janabeck.com/d3-meetup-talk/, 'tideline (and zipline) slides') at the monthly Oakland meetup for the [Bay Area D3 User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-d3-User-Group/ 'Meetup: Bay Area D3 User Group').

Feel free to [get in touch](/contact/) if you're organizing a conference or other event and are interested in having me as a speaker.
