A few months ago, I gave a talk for the [Bay Area d3 User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-d3-User-Group/ 'Meetup.com: Bay Area d3 User Group') at `d3.oakland.meetup('20141209')`, which gathered once again at the Port Workspaces in lovely Jack London Square, Oakland, CA. In the talk, I told the story of the initial and ongoing development of Tidepool's data visualization library, [tideline](https://github.com/tidepool-org/tideline 'GitHub: tideline').

I made the slides for the talk with [RevealJS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) and hosted them on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)[^a], but I thought it'd be a good idea to put a link to them here as well.

Without further ado: [tideline (and zipline) slides](http://janabeck.com/d3-meetup-talk/#/).
