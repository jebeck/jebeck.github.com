### about me

I'm Jana E. Beck‚Äî`@jebeck` most places on the Internet (e.g., [GitHub](https://github.com/jebeck 'GitHub: jebeck') and various Slack teams); [`@iPancreas`](https://twitter.com/iPancreas 'Twitter: @iPancreas') on Twitter. By profession, I am a software engineer. Currently I'm employed as a data visualization engineer in the [data science ("Algorithms") group]((http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/algorithms/ 'Stitch Fix Algorithms') at [Stitch Fix](https://www.stitchfix.com/ 'Stitch Fix'). From 2013 to 2017, I worked at [Tidepool](http://tidepool.org/ 'Tidepool homepage')[^a]. I develop web applications, working mostly on the front end in JavaScript, HTML, SVG, and CSS with modern web tools such as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/ 'React'), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/ 'Babel'), and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/ 'webpack'), to name a few of my favorite and/or most commonly used tools. I specialize in data visualization applications using React and [D3](https://d3js.org/ 'D3').

#### my background

I don't have a formal computer science education, but rather came into the field slowly, with a couple of Java courses in college, then "needs must" Python to conduct my research as a [Ph.D. student in linguistics](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~janabeck/ 'My Academic Website') at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/ 'Penn Linguistics')[^b]. During my time as a graduate student I also took a few classes via the Philadelphia chapter of [Girl Develop It](http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Philadelphia/ 'Girl Develop It: Philadelphia'). Nowadays, almost all of [the code I write](https://github.com/jebeck?tab=repositories 'GitHub: jebeck') is JavaScript, but I still sometimes hack in Python, and I aspire to learn some Clojure (and ClojureScript), if only because I spent a great deal of my time as a linguist using [LISP-inspired data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treebank 'Wikipedia: Treebank'), and I miss all the parentheses.

At any given time, I tend to have several coding side projects in flight, nearly all of them publicly visible (along with my slide decks for [talks](/speaking 'speaking')) on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/jebeck?tab=repositories "GitHub: jebeck"). I love learning about new tools, technologies, libraries, programming languages, &c by trying to actually *make* something (even if it's not a useful thing), although I don't always finish these projects since I'm prone to distraction by the next shiny new thing. I also post smaller projects and experiments on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/jebeck/ 'CodePen: jebeck') and [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/jebeck 'bl.ocks.org: jebeck').

#### about this "blog"

This blog-shaped Internet location isn't intended to be a regular (i.e., frequently updated) blog. It is mainly intended as a place for me to post things that I've done so that I can point other people to them when that need arises, as it sometimes does.

#### miscellany

‚òïÔ∏è
I am a (mostly) unrepentant coffee snob and geek. Predictably, I am very happy to be living in the Bay Area now with its vibrant coffee culture, although I tend to make and drink most of my coffee at home, most often with [Blue Bottle](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/ 'Blue Bottle Coffee') (formerly [Tonx](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/frequency/joining-forces 'Blue Bottle blog: joining forces with Tonx')) beans and one of the many coffee-making gadgets I own. (One day I'll write up a post for this site about my coffee-making gadget collection...)

‚úàÔ∏è
I love to travel. Rather than describe all my travel in 2017, I'll just give the succinct version‚Äînamely, my airport codes for all planned travel across the year: SFO, PHL, FRA, BUD, MUC, AKL, NSN, WLG, ORD, CDG, OSL, AMS, SLC, LHR, DUS, VIE, WAW, TLL, and YYZ.

üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
My relatively new favorite hobby is dance, specifically ballet. I've been training in the adult program at the [Academy of Ballet](http://sfacademyofballet.com/ 'Academy of Ballet San Francisco') in San Francisco since January of 2015. The fact that a large part of the discipline (especially in the barre portion of a class) revolves around doing exercises in clever geometric and obsessively symmetrical patterns is a not insignificant part of the appeal for me. Plus it makes me (feel) taller.

I also drop into classes‚Äîballet as well as other dance styles‚Äîfairly regularly at [LINES](http://dancecenter.linesballet.org/about/ 'LINES Dance Center') and the [SF Ballet](https://www.sfballet.org/school/adult-ballet 'SF Ballet: Adult Classes').

üòÖ
Above and beyond my dance habit, I sweat a lot. I run around Lake Merritt in Oakland, frequent Osa's *fantastic* Bootcamp at Fitness SF Oakland, and torture my muscles in new and interesting ways with TRX and various Pilates classes at [The Working Body](http://workingbody.net/ 'The Working Body'). (I like to üéø too.)

üö≤
Finally, I am dedicated to carless living as far as possible. I commute by bike and public transportation and do my shopping on foot, by bike, or with the help of public transportation. My only use of cars is restricted to the occasional [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/ 'Lyft') or [Uber](https://www.uber.com/ 'Uber') ride.
