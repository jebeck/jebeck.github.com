[^a]: I am also [@janabeck](https://github.com/janabeck 'GitHub: @janabeck') on GitHub; the latter account holds my older academic work from my time as a Ph.D. student in linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania. If that's the work of mine you're interested in, you may be more interested in [my academic website](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~janabeck/ 'Penn Linguistics: Jana Beck').

[^b]: I don't tweet all that often, but I *do* respond promptly to @mentions and DMs.
