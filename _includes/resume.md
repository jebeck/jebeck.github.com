## noteworthy projects

### ‚öõÔ∏è AA React at Stitch Fix

Designed and led development of a library of React components for internal use within Stitch Fix‚Äôs [Algorithms & Analytics department (‚ÄúAA‚Äù)](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/algorithms/ 'Stitch Fix Algorithms'). The components handle data fetching and storage from and to AA‚Äôs shared data warehouse and other internal services.

### üë©‚Äçüé§ rappstar and other CLI tools at Stitch Fix

Designed and led development of a wizard-style CLI wrapper around [create-react-app (CRA)](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/ 'Create React App') to facilitate quick and beginner-friendly app development by data scientists. The tool customizes the output of CRA to include internal dependencies and configuration. Other CLI tools include a script for building a CRA app and pushing the result to an S3 bucket set up for static web hosting.

### üìä Data Visualization at Tidepool

Led initial development of Tidepool's data visualization libraries [tideline](https://github.com/tidepool-org/tideline 'GitHub: tideline') and [@tidepool/viz](https://github.com/tidepool-org/viz 'GitHub: @tidepool/viz'). Both libraries employ React and D3 to implement UI components for interactive data visualizations in Tidepool's main web application [blip](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip 'GitHub: blip') as well as utilities for data (pre-)processing and on-the-fly calculation of a variety of statistical measures.

### üöÄ Redux Migrations at Tidepool

Led the migration of Tidepool's [uploader](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader 'GitHub: chrome-uploader') (a Chrome app) and [blip](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip 'GitHub: blip') (a web application) to use [Redux](http://redux.js.org/ 'Redux') for state management, vastly increasing test coverage for both applications in the process.

### üï∞ "Bootstrapping" to UTC at Tidepool

Designed and implemented (in the Tidepool [uploader](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader 'GitHub: chrome-uploader')) an algorithm‚Äîdubbed "bootstrapping to UTC"‚Äîfor inferring the UTC timestamp from device-relative display timestamps on diabetes devices. For more information, refer to [the technical documentation](http://developer.tidepool.io/chrome-uploader/docs/BootstrappingToUTC.html 'BtUTC technical documentation') or [the less technical blog post](http://tidepool.org/all/its-a-matter-of-time/ 'Tidepool Blog: It's a Matter of Time') explaining the feature.

### üöé Apps for Philly Transit Hackathon

Member of the winning team at the [2013 Apps for Philly Transit Hackathon](http://technical.ly/philly/2013/10/02/apps-philly-transit-hackathon-winners/ 'Technically Philly: 2013 Apps for Philly Transit Hackathon Winners'). Our project ['PHL+ to Work'](http://janabeck.com/PHLWork/ 'PHL+ to Work') ([code on GitHub](https://github.com/jebeck/PHLWork 'GitHub: PHLWork')) provides a visual interface (built with D3 and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/ 'Leaflet')) for searching American Community Survey data connecting locations (specifically census tracts) where residents of the greater Philadelphia area live to the locations where those residents commute to work.

### üå≥ Annotald at the University of Pennsylvania

Contributed to [Annotald](http://annotald.github.io/ 'Annotald'), a WebKit browser-based GUI annotation tool for constructing large corpora of syntactically annotated sentences in the Penn [Treebank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treebank 'Wikipedia: Treebank') format used by researchers in the University of Pennsylvania's linguistics department as well as at the University of Iceland, Newcastle University, and the University of York. My contributions included a refactoring of the CSS to allow users to define a customized color theme as well as helping to design and implement the [limited display mode](http://annotald.github.io/user.html#limiteddisplay 'Annotald User Manual: limited display mode').
