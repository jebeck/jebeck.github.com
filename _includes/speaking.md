## speaking

One of the things I'm enjoying most in my career switch from academia into tech is the vibrant *collaborative* culture in tech, expressed in the highest concentration at meetups and conferences. I love sharing what I've learned on the job and learning complementary lessons from others' experiences, and I'm deeply impressed, humbled, and inspired by all the speakers who put extensive amounts of time into communicating subtle or difficult or often-overlooked concepts for the benefit of all. üëè

I've also had the honor of taking the stage myself to present on a few topics:
