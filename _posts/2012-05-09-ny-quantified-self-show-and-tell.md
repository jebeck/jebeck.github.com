Yesterday I gave a short presentation at the [NY Quantified Self Show & Tell #16](http://www.meetup.com/NYQuantifiedSelf/ "NY Quantified Self Meetup") about what I learned from the last 13 months of wearing a [Dexcom continuous glucose monitor](http://www.dexcom.com/ "Dexcom website").

I wanted to put the slides I used up for anyone who'd like to take a closer look, so here they are:

- in their [original format (with many overlays)](https://github.com/jebeck/iPancreas/blob/master/show-n-tell/Beck_Quantifying_Diabetes.pdf?raw=true "My QS presentation slides") <span class="aside">[JEB, 2016: link broken, and I can't find the PDF in my back-ups ðŸ˜¢]</span>

- or in [a handy, 4-slides-per-page PDF](https://github.com/jebeck/iPancreas/blob/master/show-n-tell/Beck_Quantifying_Diabetes_Handout.pdf?raw=true "A handout of my QS presentation"). <span class="aside">[JEB, 2016: link broken, and I can't find the PDF in my back-ups ðŸ˜¢]</span>

I hope to be updating this blog soon with some further details relating to this presentation, especially with respect to testing for statistical significance when comparing two time periods of blood glucose data and using [R](http://www.r-project.org/ "The R Project for Statistical Computing") to generate various types of visualizations of blood glucose data.

Anyone who's interested in seeing a little more of the nuts-and-bolts of how the Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring sensor system works might want to check out the [photo album](https://plus.google.com/photos/114526100765491866776/albums/5626042330331112849 "Putting in a new Dexcom sensor") <span class="aside">[JEB, 2016: link broken, sorry ðŸ˜¢]</span> I made last spring demonstrating the process of inserting a new sensor.
