### about me

I'm Jana E. Beck. By profession, I am a software engineer and currently in the employ of [Tidepool](http://tidepool.org/ 'Tidepool homepage')[^a]. I develop web applications, working mostly on the front end in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with modern web tools like [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/ 'React'), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/ 'Babel'), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/ 'webpack'), and [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#readme 'GitHub: CSS modules README'), to name a few of my favorite and/or most commonly used tools. I specialize in data visualization applications using React and [D3](https://d3js.org/ 'D3').

#### my background

I don't have a formal computer science education, but rather came into the field slowly, with a couple of Java courses in college, then "needs must" Python to conduct my research as a [Ph.D. student in linguistics](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~janabeck/ 'My Academic Website') at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/ 'Penn Linguistics')[^b]. During my time as a graduate student I also took a few classes via the Philadelphia chapter of [Girl Develop It](http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Philadelphia/ 'Girl Develop It: Philadelphia'). At Tidepool, almost all of [the code I write](https://github.com/tidepool-org/viz 'GitHub: Tideline') is JavaScript, but in my spare time and myriad side projects, I sometimes hack in Python, and I aspire to learn some Clojure (and ClojureScript), if only because I spent a great deal of my time as a linguist using [LISP-inspired data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treebank 'Wikipedia: Treebank'), and I miss all the parentheses.

At any given time, I tend to have several coding side projects in flight, nearly all of them publicly visible on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/jebeck "GitHub: jebeck"). I love learning about new tools, technologies, libraries, programming languages, &c by trying to actually *make* something (even if it's not a useful thing), although I don't always finish these projects since I'm prone to distraction by the next shiny new thing. I also post smaller data visualization projects and experiments on [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/jebeck 'bl.ocks.org: jebeck').

#### about this "blog"

This blog-shaped Internet location isn't intended to be a regular (i.e., frequently updated) blog. It is mainly intended as a place for me to post things that I've done so that I can point other people to them when that need arises, as it sometimes does.

#### miscellany

‚òïÔ∏è
I am a (mostly) unrepentant coffee snob and geek. Predictably, I am very happy to be living in the Bay Area now with its vibrant coffee culture, although I tend to make and drink most of my coffee at home, most often with [Blue Bottle](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/ 'Blue Bottle Coffee') (formerly [Tonx](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/frequency/joining-forces 'Blue Bottle blog: joining forces with Tonx')) beans and one of the many coffee-making gadgets I own. (One day I'll write up a post for this site about my coffee-making gadget collection...)

‚úàÔ∏è
I love to travel. In the past year I've been to a conference in Amsterdam, spent a month in Budapest, Hungary, and took a quick weekend trip to Lima, Peru. I'm quite certain that, among other sights seen and local foods tasted, I found some of the best (if not *the* best) coffee each of these cities has to offer.

üíñ
My relatively new favorite hobby is dance, specifically ballet. I've been training in the adult program at the Academy of Ballet in San Francisco since January of 2015. The fact that a large part of the discipline (especially in the barre portion of a class) revolves around doing exercises in clever geometric and obsessively symmetrical patterns is a not insignificant part of the appeal for me. Plus it makes me (feel) taller.

üö≤
Finally, I am dedicated to carless living as far as possible. I commute by bike and public transportation and do my shopping on foot, by bike, or with the help of public transportation. My only use of cars is restricted to the occasional [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/ 'Lyft') or [Uber](https://www.uber.com/ 'Uber') ride.

[^b]: I left the Ph.D. program as an <dfn title="all but dissertation">ABD</dfn> to start working for Tidepool. I haven't regretted it once. I like engineering---namely, *making* things---much more than research.
